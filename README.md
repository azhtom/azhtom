# Hey, I’m Daniel 👋

I’m a software engineer from Lima, Peru with **10+ years building backend systems, high-scale integrations, cloud infrastructure, and AI-powered apps**.

I like shipping things that actually run: services that sync millions of records, AI agents that automate workflows, and products that make people say “this just works.”

Right now I’m building **AI applications, agent workflows, vector-based retrieval, and developer-centric architectures** for fast, reliable automation.

## 🔧 What I build

- 🧠 AI-driven systems: tool-calling agents, RAG, vector search, workflow automation  
- 🏗️ Backend services: FastAPI, Django, Go microservices, async workers, distributed flows  
- 🔌 Large-scale integrations: retail APIs, stock/price sync for 11M+ SKUs, ETL pipelines  
- ☁️ Infra & DevOps: Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform, CI/CD, AWS, GCP, Azure CA  
- 💬 Conversational products: WhatsApp bots, AI finance assistants, AI fitness coaching  
- 📊 Data & pipelines: Airflow, Presto, Pandas, optimized ingestion and transformations

## 🌍 What drives me

- I like turning ideas into real, working software — fast, but with clean architecture.  
- I’m interested in agentic systems, automation, and everything AI can simplify.  
- I build with a startup mindset: short cycles, high clarity, real impact.  
- Always open to collaborate or exchange ideas with other builders.
